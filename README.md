# iOS-Workshop-2024

This workshop serves as an quick introduction to SwiftUI. We'll be calling the Pokemon API and displaying our favorite Pokemon in a list.

Before you start, please download Xcode on your Mac from the App Store. If you search "Xcode", it should be the first result. Upon starting Xcode, you'll want to select the iOS simulator to download.
